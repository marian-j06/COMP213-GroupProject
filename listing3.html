            <h2>Listing Description</h2>
            <p>
                This custom-built modern home offers over 6,600 sq. ft. of Zen-inspired living space. The dramatic 20-foot foyer, floating staircase, and bright open layout set the tone for the main level, which includes a two-sided fireplace, executive office, and a chef’s kitchen with Miele appliances, a PITT gas cooktop, and a separate catering kitchen. Skylights, heated floors, and custom cabinetry complete the space. The primary suite features a spa-like ensuite, custom walk-in closets, and a cozy lounge with a 3-sided fireplace. Additional bedrooms have their own ensuites and built-ins, plus a flexible fourth bedroom and a custom laundry room. The lower level is built for entertainment, with a 15-seat soundproof theatre, glass-walled wine room, gym, and sleek wet bar, along with a nanny/guest suite that walks out to the landscaped yard. Modern exterior finishes, full irrigation, architectural lighting, and Control4 smart home technology make this home a true contemporary Zen retreat.
