            <h2>Listing Description</h2>
            <p>
                This stunning custom-built home blends modern style with calm, Zen-inspired design. It offers over 6,600 sq. ft. of finished living space, thoughtfully built over four years.
            <br>
                You’re welcomed by a dramatic 20-foot foyer with a glowing glass pivot door. The main floor is bright and open, featuring a floating staircase, feature walls, and warm custom woodwork. The family room includes a two-sided linear fireplace, and the executive office has custom built-ins with beautiful treetop views.
            <br>
                The chef’s kitchen is a highlight, with high-end Miele appliances, a PITT gas cooktop built into the counter, and a separate catering kitchen. Skylights, heated floors, stylish cabinetry, and a modern powder room complete the main level.
            <br>
                The primary suite is a private retreat with a spa-like ensuite, custom walnut-and-glass walk-in closets, and a cozy lounge area with a 3-sided fireplace. The additional bedrooms each have their own ensuite bathrooms and built-in cabinetry. A flexible fourth bedroom can be used however you need. The upper level also includes a fully customized laundry room.
            <br>
                The lower level is designed for entertainment and wellness. It features a 15-seat soundproof theatre, a glass-walled climate-controlled wine room, an open gym, and a modern wet bar. There’s also a nanny or guest suite with a spa-like ensuite and direct walkout to the landscaped backyard.
            <br>
                Outside, the home has modern brick and aluminum finishes, professional landscaping with irrigation, and sleek exterior lighting. Smart home technology is built in throughout, using a Control4 system for easy control of lights, temperature, and more. This home is a true modern Zen retreat—combining design, comfort, technology, and tranquility in one exceptional space.
